# Web Calculator

  This is a project I created when I was learning **JavaScript** (my first programming language), **HTML**, and **CSS** around 5 months ago. I started it as a simple calculator, but due to my lack of experience at the time, it became pretty messy. The program does work well, but I can't guarantee any understandable structure or logic â€” even I can't understand it anymore ðŸ˜…

## Features
- **It's pretty**: I really how the visual part went, the style is very neat and clean (although the visor is some pixels away from being alligned with the numpad)
- **Basic calculator operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division subsequent operations are implemented, but the way I went about it is... well, not conventional I guess.
- **Scientific notation**: Numbers too large for the display are shown in scientific notation.
- **Animations**: Some buttons flash when pressed.
- **Lots of indicators**: There are multiple flags in the code (like `addIndicator`, `subtractIndicator`, etc.), but their exact purpose may be hard to follow.
- **Debugging remnants**: I left some debug functions in the code, which helped me during the development. They might still be useful if youâ€™re brave enough to dive into it.

## Warning

- **Disorganized code**: As mentioned before, the code structure is far from ideal. It lacks clear organization, and many parts might be confusing.
- **Learning project**: Keep in mind that this was a learning project. The code reflects my experimentation and inexperience with programming languages at the time. Consider this a project from a beginner in the midst of learning.
- **Leftover code**: Thereâ€™s a lot of unused or messy code in the project. I didnâ€™t know how to use version control or Git back then, so everything I tried is still in the file.

## Why post this

Iâ€™m not planning to update this project or fix any issues â€” itâ€™s just a fun reminder of where I started! However, feel free to fork the repository and play around with it if youâ€™d like to make sense of the madness I created.
